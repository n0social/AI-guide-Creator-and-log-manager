Chrome Extension Vision:

- When a user highlights text (e.g., a food item) on any webpage, a popup appears with a "Guide me" button.
- If pressed, the popup offers options such as:
  - "How to make this recipe for your [event/holiday]"
- The extension requests access to the user's calendar.
- The guide generation adapts the How-to guide based on the selected date and season from the user's calendar (e.g., tailoring recipes for holidays or events).
- The extension will send the context (highlighted text, event/date info) to the backend for custom How-to guide creation.

Next steps: UI/UX for popup, calendar integration, and backend API adjustments for context-aware guide generation.
